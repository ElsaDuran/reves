This is just an private and extended view of Reves' official website, specially developed for you, to make it easier for you to understand and grade the project. We will guide you through the material, step by step, so you can reproduce the project from start to end. </p>
						<p style="color: #373737;font-size:20px">Reves' official website has been created for sharing our project with other users or potential clients, and that is why it's commercial-focused. It also includes a web app to use Reves. Please, take a look at it after reviewing our project.</p>
						<p style="color: #373737;font-size:20px">Thanks in advanced for all that you've teached us. We hope you enjoy our work as much as we do.</p>

					<h3>What exactly is Reves?</h3>
						<p>Reves is a Machine Learning project based on predicting movie revenue from the basic features of a movie, as genre, cast, crew, release date, budget, etc. It is a business tool mainly aimed for film producers, who want to know how much money the movie is going to make before even producing it.</p>
					<h3>Where does data come from?</h3>
						<p>This is a basic model developed using The Movies Dataset, a public project in Kaggle. Of course, the accuracy of our model is conditioned to the limited ammount of data we have in this public dataset.</p>
						<p>You can check the Kaggle website <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset/kernels">here.</a></a></p>
					<h3>Why did we decide to develope this specific project?</h3>
						<p>We wanted to create a project that would actually make sense in real life. We didn’t want to spend hours of work just for a research project to store in a drawer. The movie topic was chosen just because we liked it, and the idea of making a data-based business tool came to us analyzing the data we had, and thinking how could we make money out of it.</p>
					<h3>Why is it relevant as a Final Project?</h3>
						<p>During the developing of Reves, we have had to face the different challenges that have been raised as such from the teachers during this course: exhaustive data cleaning,choosing relevant variables, identifying and applying the most convenient ML model, visualizing the data, and, as a bonus track, applying a Deep Learning neural network in order to experience this technology and to try to better the accuracy, despite the loss of information about how the model actually works.</p>
					<h3>Which technologies have we used?</h3>
						<p><ul>
					<li>Python: for data cleaning, engineering and modelling.</li>
					<li>Tableau for data exploration.</li>
					<li>HTML & CSS for web front-end.</li>
					<li>Flask for web app backend.</li>
					<li>Google Colab and Keras for Deep Learning Bonus Track</li></ul></p>
					<h3>Why would it relevant for the industry?</h3>
						<p>Although the accuracy of our model is conditioned to the limited ammount of data we have in this public dataset, Reves hasn’t work its magic yet. It has a huge low-cost-growth-potential that will make it extremely attractive for film producing companies. The idea is simple: It is way more cheaper to collect the basic data from Internet for every movie ever made thank producing a single movie. Productions companies would only have to invest some money in harvesting the data and then apply the model (with some restructuring). Voilá: profit margins will rise.</p>

					<h3>Download data</h3>
					<p>If you haven't done so yet, you should clone or download <a href="https://github.com/ElsaDuran/reves"> our Github repo</a>. Within this files, you will find:
						<ul>
							<li>Jupyter Notebooks</li>
							<li>Python file with Reves' function library. You will import it at the beggining of each notebook, but you can review its content here.</li>
							<li>Python file with trained model</li>
							<li>Docs file with the website/webapp files. It is stored in this file in order to run the web in Github Pages.</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
					<h3>What do you need to run the project?</h3>
					<p>
						<ul>
					<li>Python 3</li>
					<li>Flask. Use <code>pip install Flask</code></li></ul></p>
					<h3>Reves' structure</h3>
					<p>Reves development is divided in different Jupyter notebook for easier understanding.
						<strong>Once in Reves, you will be able to navigate through the notebooks without having to reach this page</strong>, as we have prepared a link at the end of each notebook that will lead you to the following document.
						</br>To share data between notebooks we have used Pandas' method <code>pd.to_pickle</code> to avoid transforming lists in strings as method <code>pd.to_csv</code> does.
						</br><strong>So if you wish to review the full project, start with Cleaning Data.</strong> In case you'd like to review a specific part of the project, just go directly to it.</p>
